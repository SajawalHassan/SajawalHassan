Hi, I'm Sajawal Hassan, I am a programmer with a big passion for developing applications. From a young age, I have been amazed by the world of technology and because of it, it has led me to dive into the world of programming. When I become old, I'd like to have a business that is successful.

Over the years, I have learnt a lot of skills and become pretty good in programming languages like Javascript, Python, GdScript, C#. I am also well-versed in various frameworks such as ReactJS, NextJS, and TailwindCSS, as well as databases like MongoDB and Firebase, and back-end frameworks like ExpressJS and Django. Additionally, I have experience working with various libraries including Pandas, MatplotLib, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Numpy, Redux, Redux Toolkit, Open-CV, and Mediapipe.

My main objective is to create powerful applications that solve real-world problems. I can create applications that are user-friendly, responsive, and capable of handling large amounts of data while maintaining peak performance. I look forward to my hopefully never ending my amazing journey and working to the best I can
