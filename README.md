Hello! My name is Sajawal Hassan.

I started my programming journey with Game Development and started with Godot and because my pc at that time was not good enough for Unity I decided to move to Web development. There I learnt a lot of things and created full-stack projects which were mainly the MERN stack but I had some other as well such as with Django or NextJS. After that I decided to learn Game Development again and learned blender and a bit of Unity. I didn't really like it though so I moved to Data Science where I currently am and have created some good projects like image classifiers for digits and on some random objects. I have also worked with GANs to create images of anime faces along woth some hand drawn digits and a lot of other amazing stuff.
